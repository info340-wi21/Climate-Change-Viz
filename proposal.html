    <h1>INFO 340 Project Proposal 1 by Kellen Maier and Christopher Kim</h1>
    <section>
        <h2>Problem Description</h2>
        <p>What effect does climate change have on our world? <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/berkeleyearth/climate-change-earth-surface-temperature-data?select=GlobalLandTemperaturesByCountry.csv">Climate change</a> has a 
            huge impact every year and affects everyone on the planet. Temperatures are rising, natural disasters such as hurricanes are more common, and ice caps are melting causing sea 
            levels to rise. This major problem is one that needs to be addressed and our app aims to do that. We hope to provide a way for people to have easy access to the information necessary 
            to understand climate change and show this information in an easy to understand way.
            Beyond just showing people the impact that climate change has, we hope to provide people with options to help make a change. We can provide access to organizations 
            that are working to fight climate change as well as provide information about how an individual can lessen their own pollution/carbon footprint. Already available are 
            sites such as <a href="https://climate.nasa.gov/">NASA</a> and <a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/">IPCC</a> which provide information about climate change and the science behind it. 
            These sites provide good access to what climate change is doing but we plan to show massive data sets in ways that will linger with the viewer on the true impact of climate change.

        <h2>App Description</h2>
        <p>This app can be used and accessed by anyone that wants to help have an impact on the betterment of the wellbeing of our planet, anyone that wants to learn more about the 
            actual effects of climate change, or anyone that is simply curious about how the world has changed from it. As mentioned before, there are many sources that provide information 
            on the effects on climate change, such as <a href="https://climate.nasa.gov/">NASA</a> and <a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/">IPCC</a>. Access to this information will be included in the app as well as other sources of information. For this project one of 
            the main sources of data that we will be drawing from would most likely be csv files. We will most likely be adding more data files to the project but so far the files we will be 
            using represent <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/berkeleyearth/climate-change-earth-surface-temperature-data?select=GlobalLandTemperaturesByCountry.csv">global land temperatures</a>, and <a href="https://data.worldbank.org/topic/climate-change">CO2 emissions</a>.

            <h3>Interactions</h3>
            <p>The type of interaction the user will be able to do will be designed to help the user find more specific pieces of data including data from a certain time period or location.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>One type of interaction they can do is give two inputs in a query, representing two different years, and the app will load data that shows how much change has happened
                    from the first year to the second.</li>
                <li>Another interaction they will be able to do is select a region or country from a dropdown bar and the app will display data how much that particular region has changed
                    based on the two years from the previous interaction.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </section>

            <h3>App Goal</h3>
            <p>The goal of this app is to better inform people about the effects of climate change, and encourage them to act to make a change and try to play their part in mitigating their influence
                on the problem. By giving them access to data that shows how rampant climate change is and by showing them how much the world has actually changed, we hope this app helps to solve the
                problem by motivating enough people to act against climate change so that we can lessen the impact that it has on the world.
