    <h1>INFO 340 Project Proposal 1 by Kellen Maier and Christopher Kim</h1>
    <section>
        <h2>Problem Description</h2>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h2>App Description</h2>
        <p>This app can be used and accessed by anyone that wants to help have an impact on the betterment of the wellbeing of our planet, anyone that wants to learn more about the 
            actual effects of climate change, or anyone that is simply curious about how the world has changed from it. As mentioned before, there are many sources that provide information 
            on the effects on climate change, such as <a href="https://climate.nasa.gov/">NASA</a> and <a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/">IPCC</a>. Access to this information will be included in the app as well as other sources of information. For this project one of 
            the main sources of data that we will be drawing from would most likely be csv files. We will most likely be adding more data files to the project but so far the files we will be 
            using represent <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/berkeleyearth/climate-change-earth-surface-temperature-data?select=GlobalLandTemperaturesByCountry.csv">global land temperatures</a>, and <a href="https://data.worldbank.org/topic/climate-change">CO2 emissions</a>.
        </p>

            <h3>Interactions</h3>
            <p>The type of interaction the user will be able to do will be designed to help the user find more specific pieces of data including data from a certain time period or location.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>One type of interaction they can do is give two inputs in a query, representing two different years, and the app will load data that shows how much change has happened
                    from the first year to the second.</li>
                <li>Another interaction they will be able to do is select a region or country from a dropdown bar and the app will display data how much that particular region has changed
                    based on the two years from the previous interaction.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>App Goal</h3>
            <p>The goal of this app is to better inform people about the effects of climate change, and encourage them to act to make a change and try to play their part in mitigating their influence
                on the problem. By giving them access to data that shows how rampant climate change is and by showing them how much the world has actually changed, we hope this app helps to solve the
                problem by motivating enough people to act against climate change so that we can lessen the impact that it has on the world.
